# Clone Repository and Setup Codebase

1. **Open Visual Studio 2022**
   - Launch Visual Studio 2022 on your machine.

2. **Sign in to GitHub (if necessary)**
   - If you haven't already, you may need to sign in to GitHub from Visual Studio.
   - Go to **File** > **Account Settings** > **Add an account** and select **GitHub**.
   - Sign in using your GitHub credentials to link Visual Studio with your GitHub account.

3. **Open the Clone Repository Window**
   - In Visual Studio at the top, go to **Git** > **Clone Repository**.

4. **Enter the Repository URL**
   - Copy the repository URL from GitHub - https://github.com/Batman08/GroupProject.git
   - Paste the URL into the **Repository Location** field in Visual Studio.

5. **Select a Local Path for the Codebase**
   - Choose a local folder on your machine where you want to store the cloned repository.
   - By default, Visual Studio will create a folder for the repository in your **Source** folder, but you can specify another location.

6. **Clone the Repository**
   - Click **Clone** to begin downloading the repository.
   - Visual Studio will download all the repository files and set up a local Git environment in the chosen folder.

7. **Open the Solution**
   - Once the cloning process is complete, Visual Studio will display the solution in the **Solution Explorer**.
   - If the solution file (`.sln`) is not automatically opened, locate it in the **Solution Explorer** and double-click to open it.
